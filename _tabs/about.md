Hey, I'm Toomas ðŸ‘‹  

I love building cool stuff. Since the physical world can be limiting, I prefer to use a keyboard instead of hammer and nails (although sometimes you do need to touch grass as well). I created this site to document any interesting problems I come across while building. Mainly for processing and solidifying them in my mind. But if anyone else finds them helpful, that's great. I have had the idea to do this for a long time and just now got around to it, so I have a lot of catch-up to do... or I'll just write them as they come, let's see.

--- 

I have over 8 years of software engineering experience, during which I've worked on dev tooling, NFT projects, payment systems, e-commerce sites and much more. But I am always hungry to do more. I have outlined my experience on this page into sections: [my work experience](#work-experience), [my side projects](#projects), [hackaton projects](#hackatons), [education](#education) and [skills](#skills).

- Taking ownership of new features from design to implementation.
- Creating and managing cloud infrastructure running on Kubernetes.
- Focusing on code quality and efficient development processes.
- Learning about the Web3 ecosystem and trying to identify solvable problems for the developers in this space.

**Key achievements**
- Transaction explorer - built a public feature of Blocktorch, similar to Etherscan, but better. It was featured in an [Alchemy course](https://youtu.be/OglzIgPD-Zw?t=2520){:target="_blank"} focused on Account Abstraction.
- Built a transaction debugger and simulator for any chain with an RPC connection.
- Built a custom project-based authentication flow using Supabase Auth. It also included a system of API keys.
- Designed and implemented a metrics pipeline using TimescaleDB. Everything from reading the blockchain data, extracting and saving metrics from it, and reading it in the UI.
- Developed a feature with an SDK to catch and analyze client-side errors when interacting with the blockchain.
- Created and enforced code style rules and best practices with the team to improve our workflow.
- As an engineer in a very early-stage start-up, I learned to be extra fast, cut necessary corners, and be efficient in testing new ideas.

## Projects

##### [MurAll](https://murall.art/){:target="_blank"}  
_December 2019 - Present_  

![MurAll](/assets/img/logos/murall.png){: .left w="150" h="150" } I co-founded [MurAll](https://murall.art/){:target="_blank"}, a digital collaborative canvas living on the Ethereum blockchain.  
The main idea is that you use $PAINT tokens to contribute on a public wall, after which the tokens are burned and you get an NFT of your contribution. Since the image data is stored on-chain, it is immutable, censorship-resitant and always available.  

This was the initial idea and product, but it has become much-much more with 3 separate walls on different chains, supporting image & video, introduction of a DAO, combining MurAll NFTs into one NFT, etc. I won't go into all the details here, you can learn all about it on the [website](https://murall.art/){:target="_blank"}.

In the beginning of the project, I also worked on the smart contracts, but my main tasks were building the backend infrastructure and also the website. The backend is built on AWS serverless infrastructure using Lambdas, DynamoDB, API Gateways and S3. The frontend is a React application with the canvas as a standalone JS project.  

In addition to technical work, I also had to do a lot of business development, community management and marketing. All in all, this project has taught me a lot about building a business and the crypto space.

##### [Frames](https://frames.murall.art/){:target="_blank"}  
_October 2021 - Present_  

![Frames](/assets/img/logos/frames.png){: .left w="150" h="150" } [Frames](https://frames.murall.art/){:target="_blank"} is a really unique side-project with the MurAll team that I am really proud of. Created in the midst of the 2021 NFT bull run with PFPs and copy-cat projects pumping, this was something different and exciting.  

A **FRAME** is a dynamic NFT that you can wrap around your other existing NFTs. It will change size based on the dimensions of the NFT you combine it with and will wrap around it, enhancing its look. It even works cross-chain!

I mainly took care of the backend infrastructure and website. Similarly to MurAll, the backend is built on AWS serverless infrastructure and the website is a React application.

##### Telia's Marketing Campaign
_July 2017 - October 2017_  


![Telia](/assets/img/logos/telia.jpeg){: .left w="150" h="150" } As a freelancer I developed a website and the infrastructure for a marketing campaign. Users could add their contact information in order to take part in a prize draw.  
This was my first stand-alone project and was a good learning experience on how to build and host a website and a database, how to protect user data and build automated emails.

##### [Tallinn's Old Town Society](https://vanalinnaselts.ee/){:target="_blank"}
_January 2016 - August 2018_  

![Old Town Society](/assets/img/logos/old-town-society.jpg){: .left w="150" h="150" }  
I built and maintained [homepage for Tallinn's Old Town Society](https://vanalinnaselts.ee/){:target="_blank"} using Wordpress.

## Hackatons

##### EthGlobal Istanbul 2023
[Nazar](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/nazar-fs9ov){:target="_blank"} was my most successful hackaton project yet! A visual Account Abstraction explorer with on-chain notifications for similar transactions.

---

##### EthGlobal Paris 2023
[Voulez-Vous Authenticate](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/voulez-vous-authenticate-ik3ad){:target="_blank"} is a SSO solution for web3 wallets using Account Abstraction and zkProofs. It was a tough hack with almost no sleep for the whole weekend.

---

##### EthGlobal Lisbon 2023
One of my first hackatons with the Blocktorch team. We built an automatic discovery service and on-chain registry for optimistic rollups called [Opti-mystic](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/opti-mystic-ze5mb){:target="_blank"}!
